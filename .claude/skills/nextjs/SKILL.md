# Next.js Skill

## Version

This project uses Next.js 16+. APIs and conventions may differ from older versions.

Always check `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` for the latest documentation before writing Next.js code.

## Project Structure

```
apps/web/  (or client/)
  app/
    layout.tsx       — Root layout
    page.tsx         — Home page
    globals.css      — Global styles
  components/        — React components
  hooks/             — Custom React hooks
  lib/               — Utilities and helpers
  public/            — Static assets
```

## App Router Conventions

- Use App Router (not Pages Router)
- Server Components by default — add `'use client'` only when needed
- Client components for interactive UI (file upload, form handling)
- Server Components for static content and data fetching

## Component Patterns

- Keep components small and focused
- One component per file
- Co-locate related components
- Use CSS modules or Tailwind CSS for styling
- Avoid inline styles

## File Upload

For SQL file upload:
- Use `<input type="file">` with proper accept attributes
- Validate file type client-side before upload
- Show upload progress
- Handle errors gracefully
- Process files locally — no server upload

## State Management

- Use React state for local component state
- Use URL state for shareable state
- Avoid global state libraries — keep it simple
- Use `useState` and `useReducer` for complex local state

## Performance

- Use dynamic imports for heavy components
- Lazy load non-critical features
- Optimize images with `next/image`
- Use React Suspense for loading states
